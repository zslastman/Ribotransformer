potential goals
Convert your ixnos data object to a ribotransformer object

objectives:


1) Get a piece of code up, on github, that does something useful.

#A site alignment via codon variance alignment.
#The coding fasta would be one step.

#stuck on the autoencoder thing rn.

Okay so dts calculated from my data look reasonably like weinbergs, including
the 3 slowest codons.

I think it's just learning a uniform distribution... So does it still do this with fake data? And is that actually the optimal solution? yes it stil seems to just learn a uniform distribution. Offsets were wrong in fake data, fix
Okay 

eventually  I need to get it to learn a shape....


#pre lab meeting
okay so linear one overtaino a batch
okay so it can overtrain on a single gene

#transformer simply doesn't learn

#without positional encoder, it can overfit on a single batch
#positional encoder has the dims messed up



# okay so shuffling reveals the transformer
# learns _some_codon dependent stuff, just not that much of it

#Can we stack ixnos and the transformer?
#also realized that we have got 5 bp of noncoding base pairs for each one
