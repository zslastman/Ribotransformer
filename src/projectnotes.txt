objectives:

1) Get a piece of code up, on github, that does something useful.



#A site alignment via codon variance alignment.
#The coding fasta would be one step.



#stuck on the autoencoder thing rn.



Okay so dts calculated from my data look reasonably like weinbergs, including
the 3 slowest codons.
